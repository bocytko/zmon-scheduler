ZMON Scheduler NG
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zalando/zmon-scheduler-ng.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zalando/zmon-scheduler-ng)

This is the replacement for our current Python "zmon-scheduler" as part of the ZMON infrastructure.

This greatly improves scheduling throughput, better ontime scheduling not affected by background tasks as refreshes and makes real instant evaluation possible via ZMON frontend.
